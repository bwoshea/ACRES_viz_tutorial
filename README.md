# ACRES visualization tutorial

## Useful visualization sites:

[Duke library "visualization types" web page](https://guides.library.duke.edu/datavis/vis_types) - breaks things down into categories

[The Data Visualization Catalogue](https://datavizcatalogue.com/) - great resource, has explanations for what things do and where they're commonly used.

[Matplotlib visualization gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) 

## Books

["The Truthful Art: Data, Charts, and Maps for Communication," by Alberto Cairo](https://www.amazon.com/Truthful-Art-Data-Charts-Communication/dp/0321934075/)

["The Visual Display of Quantitative Information," by Tufte](https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/)

## Datasets

In the "statistical" subdirectory:  you will find a data file, congress-terms.csv, which includes an entry for every member of the US Congress who served between January 1947 and Februrary 2014 (and which was downloaded from the [FiveThirtyEight.com GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/congress-age)). This information contains the number of the Congress where they served, their name, birthday, starting date, and the age they were when they began that particular Congress.  For this project, letâ€™s focus on the starting ages of congresspeople and senators - how old are they when they start their terms?  Come up with two substantially different ways to visualize this data, write a piece of Python code to make those visualizations, and include the code and visualization in the repository.  You may want to use either [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) or NumPy's [loadtxt method](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html) to ingest the data, and then some sort of [matplotlib plot](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) to visualize it.

In the "time_series" subdirectory: you will find a file showing hourly temperature readings for a variety of cities around the world over several years, from 2012 through 2017 (extracted from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data)). Plot the temperature reading for Detroit for this time using a standard matplotlib line plot. In addition, try to calculate the average temperature for each month, as well as the minimum and maximum temperature for that month, and plot it on top of the raw data. What does this reveal, if anything, that the raw data does not?
