    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a great Python tool for doing data analysis and visualization.  It is based on numpy arrays and matplotlib, and makes it very easy to manipulate datasets by binning, filtering, and smoothing the data.  In particular, its profound advantage over working with standard numpy arrays is that it can work easily with strings and text, whereas numpy arrays on their own are not very good for that.\n",

We'll be using Pandas extensively in our session, so it's worth your time to experiment with this!"

The two that you may want to use in class are getting all of the information in a single row, for example in the second row:\n",

You can create a \"mask\" of true and false values (which we'll learn more about soon!) by doing simple greater than/less than/equal to tests. For example, if you want to find out which rows of the column \"age\" have values greater than 50, you'd say:\n",
    "\n",
    "    congress['age'] > 50\n",
